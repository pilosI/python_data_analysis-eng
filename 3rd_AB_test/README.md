# 3. Prioritize revenue growth hypotheses and check the priority with an A / B test.

## Project Description
The first part of the project consisted of prioritizing existing hypotheses using the <code>ICE</code> and <code>RICE</code>frameworks

The second part of the project is the analysis of the results of the A / B test

## Main tasks
Make a conclusion about the success of the test.
If the test was carried out successfully-draw conclusions about the changes made.
If the test was conducted unsuccessfully-specify the reasons and give recommendations for further actions
## Goal

Learn how to analyze the results of the A / B test, build and evaluate cumulative metrics, process anomalous values in the data, and perform statistical testing of hypotheses about the difference between groups

## Output

The test should be continued in order to neutralize the impact of outliers on the average check. We achieved a statistically significant improvement in the conversion rate.
