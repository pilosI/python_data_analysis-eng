# Study projects on data analysis in jupyter notebook.
 
## Description.
### [1. Identifying patterns that determine the success of a computer game on the market for an online store.](https://github.com/pilosI/python_data_analysis-eng-/tree/main/1st_comp_games)
Tasks:
* Prepare data
* Conduct exploratory data analysis
* Compile portraits of typical users depending on the region.
* Test statistical hypotheses
* Draw conclusions and identify patterns.

Results:
* Based on the results of the work done, the criteria for the success of the game were identified: The game was released within the last 6 years in America or Europe, in the Action genre, in the Mature age category (For adults), for the current Xbox or Playstation platform.
Recommendations for conducting an advertising campaign for an online store:
* The company should take into account the distribution region, since in Japan the emphasis should be on role playing games for the Playstation, as well as the advertising campaign should be carried out in the action genre in all regions. In Europe and North America, the emphasis should be on games for all ages (E) and adults (M), xbox one and PS4, action, shooter and possibly sports.

### [2. Business metrics analysis for Marketing Analytics.] ()
Tasks:
* Prepare data
* Calculate metrics:
 product (DAU, WAU and MAU, retention rate),
 e-commerce (LTV, Average Check),
 marketing (CAC, ROMI)  
* Identify the most successful acquisition channels
* Conduct cohort analysis and identify the most promising user cohorts

Results:
* Based on the results of the work done, the most profitable channels for attracting users were identified, as well as the most promising cohorts of users based on metrics.


### [3. Prioritize revenue growth hypotheses and test priority with A / B test.] ()
Tasks:
* Use prioritization frameworks
* Analyze A / B test

Results:
* Rated cumulative metrics
* Conducted statistical tests
* Based on the results of the analysis, the test should be continued in order to neutralize the effect of abnormal data on the average check of group B. Conversion rates have improved.

### [4. Mobile app user behavior] ()
Tasks:
* Explore the sales funnel
* Investigate the results of the A / A / B test. Assess the reaction of users to font changing.

Results:
* It was decided not to take into account the sequence of events for the A / B test, most of the users were lost when switching from the first step of the funnel.
* Based on the analysis results, we can say that the type of font does not affect user behavior. The A / B test can be completed and considered successful.

### 5. Dashboard layout for the service(on russian).
Every week, the dashboard collects information about user interaction with the service.

### [6. Fitness center customer churn forecasting.] ()
Tasks:
* Identify portraits of clients prone to churn and vice versa
* Build a churn forecasting model
* Consider the most influencing signs
* Describe key customer retention guidelines.

Results:
* Logistic regression was used to predict customer churn, which showed better results for accuracy, precision and recall metrics compared to random forest.
* The brightest groups that are highly susceptible to outflow and vice versa were identified using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. It turned out that most likely the most strongly influencing the outflow are parameters such as the frequency of visits, attendance at group sessions, and the time since the first visit to the center.
* Based on the data obtained, the main finances and efforts of the marketing department should be directed to increasing these characteristics in the target group up to 30 years.
