# 6. Predicting the outflow of fitness center customers.

## Project Description
The first part is EDA, the second part of the project is the construction of an outflow forecasting model, and the third part is the construction of a customer clustering model.

## Main tasks
Identify portraits of clients who are prone to churn and vice versa.
Build a model for predicting outflow.
Consider the most influential features.
Describe the main recommendations for customer retention.
## Goal

Learn how to conduct exploratory data analysis, use machine learning algorithms for clustering and binary classification tasks.

## Output

The most remarkable groups that are highly susceptible to churn and vice versa were identified, as well as the main parameters that affect the outflow. Recommendations are presented.
