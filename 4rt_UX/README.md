If the test was carried out successfully-draw conclusions about the changes made.
If the test was conducted unsuccessfully-specify the reasons and give recommendations for further actions
## Goal

Learn how to analyze the results of the A/B test, build and evaluate sales funnels, process data , and perform statistical testing of hypotheses about the difference between test groups.
